##  Dataset

The dataset used comes from the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**. It contains information about:
- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

## Model Used

We trained a **Logistic Regression model ,RandomForest,KNN** using `scikit-learn`.
